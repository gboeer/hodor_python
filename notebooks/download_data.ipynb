    "## Downloading Data from HODOR Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The HODOR dataset class provides flexible download functions to retrieve data based on your specific needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we create a HODOR dataset instance with a local folder called \"HODOR\" where all downloaded files will be stored. The dataset will automatically skip downloading files that already exist locally, making it safe to re-run download commands without duplicating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Create dataset instance and download sequence 1\n",
    "hodor = HODOR_Dataset(dataset_folder=\"HODOR\")\n",
    "hodor.download_sequence(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All downloaded files (videos, sonar data, and metadata) will be organized within the specified dataset folder. The downloader checks for existing files and only downloads what's missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download Options\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complete Sequences**: Download both video and sonar data for entire sequences using sequence IDs\n",
    "    - Single sequence: Pass an individual sequence ID\n",
    "    - Multiple sequences: Pass a list of sequence IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Video Data Only**: Download just the video files for specified sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sonar Data Only**: Download just the sonar files for specified sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading Strategy \n",
    "\n",
    "For single sequences, no Pangaea account is required. However, downloading the entire dataset at once requires registration at Pangaea and is not recommended due to the large dataset size. A better approach is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First examine the included activity counts data to identify sequences with interesting species activity\n",
    "2. Use the sequence IDs to selectively download only the sequences relevant to your research\n",
    "3. This targeted approach is more efficient and avoids unnecessary data transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note about Pangaea Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "The HODOR dataset is hosted on [Pangaea](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.980000), which uses a hierarchical storage system. If files haven't been accessed recently, they may be stored on tape storage rather than immediately available disk storage. When you request such files, Pangaea will automatically retrieve them from tape storage, which can take some time (depending on the file size and system load).\n",
    "\n",
    "The downloader is designed to handle this automatically - it will wait for the file retrieval process to complete and then proceed with the download once the files become available on disk storage. You may notice longer download times for files that need to be retrieved from tape storage compared to files that are already available on disk."
